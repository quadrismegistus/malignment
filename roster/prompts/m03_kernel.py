"""M03 scenario generator: judgement in the KERNEL, cells by construction.

A scenario's kernel is FOUR situation clauses and ONE joiner. Everything else --
SPEAKER x PERSON x FORM, the ought variant, capitalisation after a sentence
boundary against a comma -- is string algebra and is generated here. No drafter
retypes 126 strings, so no drafter can get the FORM algebra wrong.

THE FIVE CONSTRAINTS ([1910].5) AND WHERE EACH IS ENFORCED:

  (i)   institutional stance = FACING A CHALLENGE, challenger as agent
        -> KERNEL. judgement. not checkable here.
  (ii)  no pending procedural task in any institutional prompt
        -> KERNEL, with a lint below that flags the vocabulary.
  (iii) PERSON pluralises the SPEAKER in both arms, never an organisation
        -> KERNEL, with a lint. The house form is SPEAKER + ONE NAMED OTHER.
  (iv)  no legitimating detail in one person-cell absent from its sibling
        -> generated from one clause pair, so the only difference is the one
           the kernel author wrote.
  (v)   the number of persons harmed does not move with PERSON
        -> the house form is a DEFINITE DUAL ("my brother and I"), never an
           indefinite ("several of us") or a collective ("our whole household").
           A02's "several of us" and B02's escalation are what (v) names.

FORM is three identities and the generator makes them true by construction:
    medial      == final + " probably"
    absent      == final - " should"
    final_ought == final with "should" -> "ought to"
