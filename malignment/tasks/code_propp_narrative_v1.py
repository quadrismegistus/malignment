"""Propp's plot functions as a general narrative syntax, not a wondertale test.

Adapted from `largeliterarymodels.tasks.classify_propp` (litmod, 2026-08-31).
The function inventory, the span discipline and the schema are theirs. What is
changed is the SCOPE CLAIM, and only that.

## WHY A LOCAL VARIANT

Measured on 60 pure LLM national stories with the shipped instrument:

    is_tale_structured   3/60
    function counts      0 x57,  5,  9,  11

Bimodal, 95% zero. The shipped prompt instructs the model to withhold
annotation once it judges the text not a wondertale ("set is_tale_structured to
false and return few or no functions"). I removed that instruction and re-ran the
SAME 60 texts: 3/60 again, 95% zero again. So the withholding rule is not what
produces the emptiness, and the override was verified to apply -- a forced-empty
prompt turns 9 functions into 0 and the instrument hash moves.

The emptiness therefore comes from the FRAMING, which is upstream of any single
rule: the docstring scopes the scheme to Afanasyev, the four few-shot examples
are Russian wondertales, and `is_tale_structured` is posed as a gate on whether
the scheme applies at all.

**That scope claim is Propp's own modesty about HIS corpus, and narratology has
not honoured it since.** Greimas's actantial model is derived from these
functions; Bremond, Todorov and most of film and media narratology apply them to
material Propp never saw. A departure is a departure in a story about a Tel Aviv
cafe. Treating "is this an Afanasyev wondertale" as the precondition for
annotating a departure imports a historical restriction as a measurement rule.

## WHAT CHANGED, EXACTLY

  - the SCOPE paragraph and rule 6 are rewritten: annotate what is present,
    and judge tale-likeness SEPARATELY rather than as a precondition
  - `is_tale_structured` is retained but demoted to a description of the whole,
    explicitly NOT a gate on the annotation
  - `scheme_fit` is added: a graded three-way reading, because the binary is
    what makes the output bimodal in use

Everything else -- inventory, span requirement, move numbering, event_order,
the four examples -- is unchanged, so results remain comparable to litmod's
calibration against Propp's printed schemes (recall 0.79, precision 0.62,
order 0.43 on 22 Afanasyev tales).

## THE CALIBRATION THAT STILL HOLDS, AND THE ONE THAT DOES NOT

Their span audit transfers: a function must be anchored to a quoted span and
`locate_spans`/`span_report` check it. Their recall/precision against Propp does
NOT transfer to this variant, because the instrument text differs. Anything
claiming agreement with Propp must be re-measured; this file is for COMPARING
GENERATORS, where the dependent variables are function count, move count and
sequence agreement BETWEEN arms, none of which needs Propp to be right.

Self-agreement is a ceiling on all of it: litmod measured 5/24 identical
sequences at temperature 0, LCS 0.82. One annotation is one draw. Use sample=.

# ── Propp's functions: the 34 top-level symbols ────────────────────────
# Ordered as Propp orders them. `stage` follows Propp's OWN sectioning
# (Appendix I, "Materials for a Tabulation of the Tale", pp. 119-127), not
# the six-stage scheme common in secondary literature — which differs in
# two substantive ways. There is no separate "transference" stage: G sits
# with the struggle, and the donor bloc is D-E-F only. And struggle and
# return are not separate stages: H J I K ↓ Pr Rs are one continuous
# block. Propp also treats H-I and M-N as ALTERNATIVE central developments
# rather than sequential ones, so a vocabulary ordering struggle before
# recognition encodes a sequence he explicitly calls a fork.

# ── Instrument ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""\
You are annotating a short narrative text with Vladimir Propp's plot
functions, as set out in Morphology of the Folktale (1928).

THE CENTRAL DIFFICULTY, and the thing this annotation is for: a Proppian
function is defined by the ROLE an action plays in the plot, not by what
the action is. Propp's own point is that the same act is a different
function depending on where it stands, and that different acts can be the
same function. A hero riding away from home is 'departure' only if it opens
the route the narrative then follows; if he is merely stepping out and will
be back before anything happens, it is 'absentation'. A fight is 'struggle'
if the hero wins the object of his quest by it, and 'donor_first_function'
if he wins the means of continuing his search. Do not classify on
vocabulary. Ask what the action does to the plot.

THE FUNCTIONS

{FUNCTION_GLOSSARY}

RULES

1. Work through the text once, in reading order, and list every function
   you find. A function may occur more than once — Propp's tales repeat
   them, and the donor sequence is classically trebled. List each
   occurrence separately.

2. Quote spans VERBATIM. Copy the exact characters from the text, including
   its spelling and punctuation. The spans are checked against the source
   and a paraphrase is recorded as an error. Keep each span to the shortest
   stretch that carries the function.

3. Number the moves. A move is one complete development from a villainy or
   a lack through to its resolution. Most tales have one. A fresh villainy
   after the first has been resolved opens move 2 — the classic case is the
   hero's brothers stealing the prize on the way home — and moves can be
   embedded rather than merely consecutive. Functions are ordered WITHIN a
   move, so a villainy belonging to move 2 rightly appears after move 1's
   wedding.

4. Two alternations to keep straight. Villainy (A) and lack (a) are
   alternatives filling one slot, not one a kind of the other: a tale is
   set going by one or the other. And struggle/victory (H-I) and difficult
   task/solution (M-N) are alternative central developments — most tales
   take one road or the other, and a few take neither.

5. Watch the order of branding and victory. In Propp's sequence the hero is
   branded (J) BETWEEN the struggle (H) and the victory (I). The letters
   are counter-intuitive and are easy to transpose.

6. ANNOTATE WHAT IS PRESENT. JUDGE THE WHOLE SEPARATELY. Propp drew this
   scheme from Russian wondertales, but narratology has applied these
   functions far beyond them, and a departure is a departure in a story set
   in a modern city. So do BOTH of these, independently:
     - record every function you can anchor to a span, whatever the text is;
     - set is_tale_structured true only for a text actually built as a tale,
       with a villainy or lack driving it to a resolution.
   A text may legitimately have five functions and is_tale_structured false.
   That is the normal case for modern short fiction and is not a contradiction.
   Do not pad, and do not withhold. An empty answer is legitimate only when
   the text really contains no anchorable function.

7. Where a span is a poor fit that you assigned anyway, say so in its note.
   A recorded doubt is more useful than a confident label.

    """Normalise a tale text before annotating it.

    Two transformations, both of which measurably change results rather
    than merely tidying:

    HARD LINE-WRAPPING. The 19th-century translations in data/propp are
    wrapped at ~54 characters. Any quoted span crossing a line break then
    fails an exact match, so the verbatim rate measures the typesetting
    instead of the model — on a first pass it read 9%, and 85% after
    unwrapping, with no change in model behaviour. Paragraph breaks are
    preserved; mid-sentence breaks are joined.

    INLINE FOOTNOTE MARKERS. The same editions carry editorial apparatus
    inside the sentence ("put forth his might,[283] and said"). 14 of the
    24 packaged tale texts contain them. A model quoting the sentence
    naturally omits the marker, and the span then fails verification for a
    reason that has nothing to do with the annotation. Set
    strip_footnotes=False to keep them.

    PROVENANCE HEADERS. Every packaged tale text opens with a header —
    Afanasyev number, titles, translator, source URL — closed by a
    full-width rule. It also carries a one-line content note ("the boy who
    understands birds and rises to greatness"), so feeding the file
    verbatim hands the annotator the tale's title AND a summary of its plot
    before it reads a word. That contaminates every judgement the task
    makes, and `is_tale_structured` most of all. Everything up to and
    including a rule in the first 20 lines is dropped. Set
    strip_header=False to keep it.

    EMPHASIS MARKUP. Gutenberg-style underscores ("thirty _puds_ of hemp",
    9 of 24 files) fail the same way, and the failure is worse because it
    reads as a fabricated quote: the span looks invented when the model
    merely dropped a typographic marker. Set strip_emphasis=False to keep
    it.

    NONE OF THIS IS A NO-OP ON CLEAN TEXT. Every option alters text that
    merely resembles the apparatus it targets: `foo_bar_baz` loses its
    underscores, a literal "[3]" disappears, and — the one that matters —
    text using SINGLE newlines between paragraphs is joined into one
    paragraph by join_wrapped. On material that carries no editorial
    apparatus (LLM output, clean modern prose) pass
    strip_footnotes=False, strip_emphasis=False, strip_header=False, and
    set join_wrapped only if the source really is hard-wrapped.

    Deliberately NOT part of the Task: this changes the item text, so it
    changes the cache key, and a silent normalisation inside run() would
    make two callers with the same file disagree about what they
    administered. Call it explicitly and the key records what was sent.
