"""One way to ask ClickHouse a question.

    from malign_logits import ch

    ch.query("SELECT model, count() AS n FROM {db}.twp_words GROUP BY model")
    ch.scalar("SELECT count() FROM {db}.twp_words")

WHY THIS EXISTS, IN EVIDENCE RATHER THAN IN PREFERENCE. On 2026-08-14 a survey
found 85 files touching ClickHouse and 69 of them shelling out themselves, plus
TWO private `_q` helpers inside this library that had diverged from each other.
The duplication is the least of it. Every hand-rolled reader repeats the same
three defects, and all three are defects this campaign has already paid for:

  1. **SILENT ROW DROPS.** `ch_read._q`'s consumers do `if len(f) == 4:` and
     `gens._q` does `if len(f) != len(head): continue`. A row that does not
     split into the expected shape is discarded with no count, no file and no
     cause. That is the receiptless disposition booked at [6127] -- and the
     accounting identity that would have caught it cannot, because a dropped
     row enters neither side of it.

  2. **TSV ESCAPING BY HAND.** `ch_read._unesc` exists because omitting it made
     a reconciler report 88 of 250 cells as disagreeing (`didn\\'t` against
     `didn't`) on a table holding zero backslashes. `gens._q` takes an
     `unescape_cols` argument, so the guard is OPT-IN and any string column
     nobody named keeps its escaping. And at [6065] a `TSVRaw` export -- which
     does not escape newlines at all, on prompts that contain them -- returned
     1,621,740 lines against a true 964,679, manufacturing a divergence between
     two stores that did not exist.

  3. **THE FORMAT DECIDES THE POPULATION.** Which is (2) stated generally: a
     serialisation format is a population definition, and a reader that splits
     on a delimiter is asserting that the delimiter does not occur in the data.

**JSONEachRow DISSOLVES ALL THREE.** There is no delimiter to collide with, no
escaping convention to reverse, and a row that will not parse raises instead of
vanishing. It is also already what 61 of the 74 external call sites use, so this
is the majority convention rather than a new one.

**WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO.** It does not open a connection, pool anything,
or add a dependency: it shells out to the same binary every caller already
shells out to. The value is not the transport, it is that the transport is in
one place with the three lessons above already applied.

**`{db}` IN A QUERY IS SUBSTITUTED** with the configured database, so callers
stop writing `%s.twp_words % DB` and stop getting it wrong when DB is not the
default.
