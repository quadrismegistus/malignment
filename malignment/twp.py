"""twp.py — the true-word-probability instrument.

**EXTRACTED VERBATIM from `scripts/twp_cloud.py` lines 1-788 on 2026-08-09.**
Not rewritten, not tidied, not improved: a pure move, so that the boundary rule
has ONE home and a caller reaches it by import rather than by copying seventy
lines. `scripts/twp_cloud.py` is UNCHANGED and remains the running producer until
this copy is verified against the store; see `scripts/verify_twp_extraction.py`.

WHY IT MOVED. `scripts/` is not importable, so every consumer -- the M01 word-lens
pilot most immediately -- reaches the rule through a `sys.path` insert or by
duplicating it. **A second copy of a boundary rule is a second policy.** The rule
is `rule_version 3` plus `dict_sha b16011275c42955c` and it carries a CJK prefix
trie, script-transition boundaries, intra-word punctuation unmasking, a mojibake
channel and a four-way residual: roughly seventy lines of accumulated rulings.

WHAT MUST NOT CHANGE, and is asserted rather than hoped:

    RULE_VERSION   3, keyed across 301,147 stored cells. The rule is not
                   changing, only its address. Bump it and the key space splits.
    dict_sha       b16011275c42955c. DICT resolves as
                   <module dir>/../data/dict/jieba_dict_big.txt, and
                   `scripts/` and `malign_logits/` are both one level below the
                   repo root, so the expression is literally identical.

KNOWN DEFECT CARRIED OVER DELIBERATELY. `_BATCH` is module-level mutable state
that `next_dist` reads and writes for OOM backoff -- correct for a single-process
runner, wrong for a library two callers might drive at once. **Left as-is**: this
commit changes no behaviour, and fixing it here would mean the extraction and a
behaviour change could not be told apart if the verification failed.

    python twp_cloud.py --models models.txt --out /workspace/twp

WHY JSONL AND NOT THE STASH. HashStash is lmdb: one large file that changes on
every write, so rsync re-transfers the whole thing each sync and a kill mid-write
risks the store. Here each line is a COMPLETE record appended and flushed, so a
kill loses at most the line in flight, a finished model's file never changes
again, and repeated rsync pulls only the model currently in progress.

The local machine keeps HashStash as the canonical store; these files merge into
it through CacheManager, where the pinned open is enforced. Same round trip as
F37, which worked.

MODELS ARE PROCESSED SMALLEST FIRST and the HF cache entry is deleted after each,
because the binding constraint is DOWNLOAD (~1.3 TB for the roster), not compute.
Ascending order also means anything too large for the card sorts to the end,
where cancelling costs nothing.

# Metaspace pre-tokenizer over the ByteLevel one a repo's tokenizer.json
# declares. On deepseek-llm-7b that deletes every space -- 'She was so angry she
# wanted to' encodes and decodes as 'Shewassoangryshewantedto' -- and drops CJK
# entirely, with unk_token=null so nothing raises. PR #45936 fixed models with
# bespoke architecture tags; #47017 would fix generic model_type=llama repos and
# is NOT merged as of transformers 5.4.0.
#
# The entry retires VISIBLY when upstream lands the generic fix: precondition 6

#
# internlm2 is the SAME DEFECT WITH A DIFFERENT CLASS, found 2026-08-10 by a
# fleet writing 402 skip records. `AutoTokenizer` resolves it to the repo's
# bundled `InternLM2TokenizerFast` (fetched under trust_remote_code), whose
# pre-tokenizer SHIFTS word boundaries rather than deleting spaces:
#
#     sent  'He lay naked in his bed and'
#     got   'H elay n aked inh is bed and'
#
# `twp` refuses the cell -- correctly, since a boundary shift makes every
# word-level probability a probability of a different word. Both arms fail
# identically, so the PAIR is recoverable and was never lost.
#
# **IT DOES NOT REPRODUCE ON THIS MAC AND THAT IS THE POINT.** Local
# transformers is 5.4.0 and the fleet's is 5.14.1; AutoTokenizer picks a
# different class on each, so the round-trip is clean here and broken there. A
# fidelity verdict taken locally would have declared internlm2 fine and been
# wrong about every box -- which is why capability facts are keyed
# (model x environment) in data/model_load_environments.json rather than by
# model alone.

# ── TWP AT EVERY LAYER, ON ONE SET OF FORWARD PASSES ──────────────────────
#
# **THE COST ARGUMENT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS IS AFFORDABLE.** Every
# forward pass already computes every layer. What a per-layer word lens needs
# is not more passes but more READOUTS of the passes it is already paying for.
# So the expense is set by the UNION of prefixes any layer wants expanded, not
# by n_layers x the single-layer cost. Layers share prefixes heavily -- the
# first token of `kill` is the first token of `kill` at layer 8 and layer 31 --
# so the union is far smaller than the sum.
#
# **PER-LAYER PRUNING IS PRESERVED EXACTLY, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE REFUSAL.**
# The tempting alternative is to let a path survive if ANY layer keeps it above
# theta and then score it at every layer, which yields a denser table. It also
# means the final layer no longer reproduces the stored twp cell -- it would
# accumulate mass along paths solo-twp pruned -- and the free validation would
# be gone. Each layer therefore keeps its OWN theta frontier and its own
# residual, identical to what a solo run at that layer would produce. The union
# schedules the compute; it does not change any layer's arithmetic.
#
# Mass is a product of probabilities and therefore monotone decreasing along a
# path, so a path once below theta for a layer never returns above it. That is
# what makes `live_L == {p : mass_L(p) >= theta}` exactly, and what makes the
# per-layer frontier recoverable from the union without bookkeeping.
#
# **A WORD MISSING AT A LAYER IS CENSORED, NOT ZERO.** If layer 31 reads
# `kill 0.23` and layer 14 does not reach it, layer 14's value is `< theta`,
# not 0 -- the same censoring twp has always had at its floor, and the
# crossings of that floor are the trajectory. Writing 0 would turn a threshold
# into a measurement.
