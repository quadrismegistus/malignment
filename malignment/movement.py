"""Risers and fallers: ONE implementation, importable, for logits AND true_word_probs.

    from malign_logits.movement import movement, CANONICAL, DRAW, LENS

    m = movement(pre_word_probs, post_word_probs)       # true_word_probs dicts
    m = movement_from_logits(pre_logits, post_logits)   # full-vocabulary arrays
    m.risers, m.fallers, m.excess["scream"], m.diagnostics

WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now nothing in the package defined a riser or a faller. The
definitions lived in fourteen scripts, and `scripts/f13_movement_table.py` was written to
end that -- its own docstring records the cost: "every seat derived fallers and risers on
the fly from the logits, and the derivations disagreed -- 1,650 cells against 3,366 on the
same question, because the thresholds and the cell filters lived in three scripts instead
of one file." **It fixed the logits path and the true_word_probs path never adopted it.**

So TWO INCOMPATIBLE RULES ARE CURRENTLY IN USE and both are shipped here, named, because
silently unifying them would invalidate work already done under each:

    CANONICAL   f13_movement_table.py. Tests risers against the RENORMALISATION NULL.
    LENS        per-layer depth work. Symmetric ratio at theta, NO null test, so its
                risers include renormalisation bookkeeping. Looser on purpose: set size
                is what a per-layer estimate's stability depends on.
    DRAW        f13_draw_relation_items.py, and f13_code_amber_stages.py which imports
                its constants. NO NULL TEST AT ALL -- a riser is anything gaining >= DT.
                This is what feeds the annotation item draw, so it is what M01's
                clauses 5-6 rest on. Kept because it is load-bearing, NOT because it is
                right; new work should take CANONICAL and say so.

THE CANONICAL RULE, and the null is the whole point of it:

    faller  iff  P >= min_prob  AND  Q < fall_ratio * P
    R = 1 - sum_fallers Q       mass left over once the fallers have fallen
    S = sum_non-fallers P       pre-mass of everything that did not fall
    null = P * (R / S)          what each survivor gets from PURE RENORMALISATION
    riser   iff  not faller  AND  max(P,Q) > min_prob
                 AND  (Q - P) > delta        moved enough to matter
                 AND  Q > null               MORE than renormalisation explains

Without the last line a "riser" is any word that went up, and every word goes up a little
when a faller's mass is removed. The null is what separates redistribution from bookkeeping.

ASYMMETRY, DECLARED AND PRESERVED FROM THE ORIGINAL: risers are tested against the null;
FALLERS ARE NOT. A faller is a bare ratio rule. **Nothing downstream may describe fallers
as "beyond renormalisation"** -- they are not tested for it, and a word can halve purely
because mass left the system elsewhere.

THE true_word_probs CASE, AND ITS ONE HONEST COMPROMISE. The null needs total mass, and
`true_word_probs` is truncated at theta: the scored words sum to 1 - residual, with the
rest in one undifferentiated bucket. So R and S cannot be computed over the full
vocabulary. THE RESIDUAL IS CARRIED AS AN EXPLICIT NON-FALLER MASS rather than dropped or
renormalised away -- dropping it inflates every survivor's null, renormalising deletes the
mass that left the scored set entirely, which on this instrument is a quarter of the
distribution. `diagnostics["residual_share"]` reports how much of the distribution the
approximation rests on, and `diagnostics["exact_null"]` is False whenever it is used.

**A null computed over a truncated support is APPROXIMATE and says so.** Read
`residual_share` before quoting an excess: at 0.26 the bucket is larger than most words.

# 6-12 fallers on a Llama cell, and a bootstrap band over 6 words is wide enough that the

        **Excess is ZERO-SUM across the survivors.** sum_non-fallers null == R by
        construction, and sum_non-fallers Q == R too, so the excesses cancel to zero
        over the union support (verified: 1e-07 on a live cell). Excess is therefore a
        REDISTRIBUTION AMONG SURVIVORS laid on top of proportional renormalisation --
        not a share of anything the fallers gave up.

        departed      mass that left the fallers. The magnitude of the repression.
        arrived       positive excess on the flagged risers. The magnitude of the
                      SELECTIVE uptake.
        tail_excess   the residual bin's OWN excess, and the substitution-vs-deflection
                      quantity: POSITIVE means mass went into the unresolved tail beyond
                      what renormalisation hands it -- the step dispersed. NEGATIVE means
                      the tail gave mass up to nameable words -- the step substituted.
        selectivity   arrived / departed. **NOT a share of `departed`** -- the zero-sum
                      identity above means the two have no ordering relation and this
                      routinely exceeds 1. Read it as selective uptake per unit repressed:
                      near 0 is pure renormalisation, large is a step that promotes
                      particular words while it demotes others.
        captured      arrived / all positive excess. THIS one is a 0-1 share: how much of
                      the selective uptake landed on words the rule flags at all, rather
                      than dribbling across words below its thresholds.
        concentration top riser's share of `arrived`. Scale-free, so unlike JS it does not
                      shrink when a tokenizer resolves a language coarsely -- it asks how
                      the resolvable mass DISTRIBUTED itself, not how much there was.
        tail_share    js_tail / js_total. **The diagnostic that decides whether a
                      cross-language JS comparison means anything**: high here says the
