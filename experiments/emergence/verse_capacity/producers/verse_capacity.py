"""Verse capacity, first read: rhyme pull at the declared slots, per rung.

    uv run python experiments/emergence/verse_capacity/producers/verse_capacity.py

Instrument 1 of plan_verse_fleet.md (rhyme pull/floor) plus instrument 8's
free column (copy vs class), run against the ingested fleet ([5886],
commit 538e6b1a). What this is and is not:

  IS   per-(model, cell) class mass at all 1,620 verse slots, and the
       per-rung PRIMARY contrast under the declared depth constraint:
       called vs {mid4, near} (depth-matched, 4 lines each), paired
       within poem, collision-aware ([5753] §2: where near duplicates
       mid4 the pool is ONE slot); companion called-vs-end3 beside it.
  NOT  the closure decomposition (line_closure x rhyme_given_closure):
       the closure rider NEVER RAN in the fleet (corrected [6062]:
       zero close_given_class / p_close_actual fields in any fleet
       jsonl; the earlier "rides the .f16 tier" wording in this
       docstring was mine and was never checked against the output).
       What the tier DOES hold is the full next-token distribution at
       each slot, from which line_closure = P(newline | context) is
       computable offline at zero cost and from nothing else -- twp
       stores ~107 words against a 0.673 residual, with newline
       unbroken-out inside `drop`. The rhyme_given_closure half needs
       fresh forwards regardless. This read is word-mass only.
       ROUTE WARNING FOR WHOEVER WRITES THAT RIDER ([6059], malign;
       verified here): the tier is not reachable through the cache
       layer. `data/logit_dir_resolution.json` maps cloud_run_20260801
       and f11_twp only, and `data/logit_index_provenance.json`
       resolves basenames under MALIGN_LOGIT_ROOT, defaulting to
       cloud_run. NEITHER CONTAINS A VERSE_FLEET ENTRY, so
       `cache.get_logits` cannot see these 58.9 GiB. The rider must
       either extend the dirmap or read the merged directory directly
       -- and if RH migrates the tier, whichever route it takes has to
       point at wherever it went.
  NOT  any across-depth gradient read as locality ([5751]/[5752]).

Read discipline: the store's analysis key is (model, prompt, word) and
the storage key carries source — the fleet's overlap rows live under
older labels ([5886]: per-model 1,688 under verse_fleet vs 1,786
distinct prompts), so selection is BY THE MANIFEST'S PROMPT SET across
all sources at rule_version 3, deduped max(p) per analysis key, then
case-folded by summing (the ingester's own fold convention). Censored
share (expand's theta=0.001 residual) travels per cell and is quoted
per stratum, per the plan's theta declaration.

Pull definition (instrument 8's split): class_pull = target-class mass
MINUS p(target word itself) — rhyme as repetition-with-difference; the
copy curve p(target word) is kept as its own column. The nonpartner
class is the control WHERE UNCALLED (NONPARTNER_CALLED_AT in the
producer: it is itself called at end1/end3 under ABAB, end1/end2 under
AABB — the flag travels).

Outputs (results/, or --out):
  verse_capacity_cells.parquet   one row per (model, manifest cell)
  verse_capacity_rungs.parquet   one row per (model, scheme-class, era):
                                 paired called-minus-null pull, companion
                                 contrast, copy, censored share
