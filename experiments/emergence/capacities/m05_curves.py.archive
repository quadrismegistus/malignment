"""M05 curve extraction: every registered trajectory, one tidy table.

    MALIGN_TWP_SOURCE=clickhouse uv run python experiments/emergence/capacities/m05_curves.py
    ... --smoke        # only checkpoints already in CH (mains + preflight)

Written BEFORE the fleet landed (RH's word, 2026-08-11) so the analysis
exists before the numbers and nothing is shaped post-hoc. Reads ClickHouse
through the one choke point (`movement.word_probs`, which owns the
partition fold and the malformed-row refusals -- ch_read.py's own doctrine).

WHAT IT EMITS -- data/m05_curves.parquet, long format, one row per
(checkpoint, curve, probe, word-role): the raw trajectories every plan-A
analysis aggregates. Aggregation (bootstrap CIs over prompts, onset
detection, the paired onset contrast) happens in the write-up stage over
this table; this script is the extractor and does not editorialise.

CURVES (plan A registrations in brackets):
  PANEL      p(faller|prompt), p(riser|prompt) on the PAIRS_105 marked arm --
             each prompt carries its own faller/riser from the sample's csv,
             so this is the onset-ordering PRIMARY at prompt grain [primary]
  CAPACITY   log p(target)/p(competitor) per probe, five families
             [base-arm primary + Weatherby curves]
  POETIC     pull = p(t|FORMULAIC) - p(t|PARAPHRASE) AND floor = p(t|FORMULAIC)
             -- "plot pull and floor together or not at all" [5379]
  (quint contradiction ratio, pole_sep, and the syntax curve are separate
   instruments: the ratio has its own producer, pole_sep needs the hidden
   sidecar, syntax needs the frozen licit-artifact. Not duplicated here.)

ABSENT-WORD POLICY, DECLARED: twp is complete above theta=0.001 ([5136]), so
a word absent from a payload has p < theta. It enters as p = theta/2 with
absent=True carried on the row -- the flag travels to the write-up, which
must report absence rates beside any ratio built on them. An absent CELL
(checkpoint x prompt not in the store) is a gap, not a measurement: the row
is NOT emitted and the gap is counted in the coverage table printed at the
end. Absent and empty never share a branch.
