# Finding M05-E: the Pythia ladder resolves the tie — packages first, facts after phrases, discourse last (cross-ladder)

Written 2026-08-11 by the registrar seat. STATUS: FIRST LOOK, grade C —
one lineage (Pythia-6.9b), descriptive, instruments copied from the OLMo
ladder so the two are read by one rule; no cross-seat audit. A SEPARATE
STUDY from M05's OLMo population and never pooled with it ([5425](b),
[5430]): different lab, tokenizer (50,277 vs 100,278) and corpus. Every
comparison below is CROSS-LADDER and labelled so. Re-derives from:

    MALIGN_TWP_SOURCE=clickhouse uv run python meta/M05_emergence/scripts/m05_curves.py \
        --population data/pythia_population.json --out data/pythia_curves.parquet
    uv run python meta/M05_emergence/scripts/m05_pythia_capacity.py

Readable exhibits (top of the distribution, both ladders, selected rungs,
two probes per family): `../results/capacity_examples.md`
(`scripts/m05_capacity_examples.py`).

Population: `data/pythia_population.json`, 155 checkpoints (154 pretraining
rungs, log-spaced 0,1,2,4,...,512 then 1000-step to 143000, plus `main`),
malign's fleet [5430], 90,170/90,170 cells. Battery: the same 584 texts by
declaration (sha e5a4f5f). Curves: `data/pythia_curves.parquet`, 80,290
rows. Results: `results/pythia_capacity_onsets.json`. Onset criterion
copied from `m05_onsets.py`: first rung whose bootstrap CI of the median
log p(target)/p(competitor) sits above zero and stays there to the end of
the arm; plus a coverage gate (>= 10 surviving probes) because Pythia's
early rungs are absent-dominated and a sign-only onset can fire on two
cells at imputation scale.

## Result 1: the four-way tie OLMo left-censored now resolves

On OLMo, packages, reference, reasoning and poetic pull all onset at the
first usable rung (stage1-2000) — a tie the release schedule could not
break, because Allen AI's finest granularity is 1,000 steps. Pythia's
log-spaced early rungs break it:

    family              Pythia onset (gated n>=10)     OLMo onset (cross-ladder)
    semantic packages   step 2000  (n=31 at onset)     stage1-2000  } four-way
    poetic pull         step 2000  (sign-onset 512,    stage1-2000  } tie,
                                    but at n=2)        stage1-2000  } left-
    reasoning           step 3000                      stage1-2000  } censored
    reference (facts)   step 4000                      stage1-2000  }
    discourse tracking  step 80000 (see Result 3)      stage1-32000

The ordering that emerges — packages before reasoning before reference —
is the one the OLMo half-max milestone already suggested (packages 4k <
reasoning 6k < reference 11k, POST-HOC), now visible at onset grain on a
second lab's ladder. The phrase reaches significance before the fact on
both ladders: Pythia half-max packages 2000 vs reference 12000 (POST-HOC,
same direction as OLMo's 4k vs 11k).

Combined views (added 2026-08-11, after finding F): all families plus
poetic pull and the syntax curve, normalized for ordering —
`../figures/fig18_acquisition_ladder_pythia.png` (vendor grid) and
`../figures/fig17_acquisition_tokens_pythia.png` (token clock, absent
rate beside the curves per [5436]).

## Result 2: the sub-1000 window has words before it has capacities

[5430] found the battery's vocabulary rising eight-fold between step 8 and
step 128 (words resolved per cell 5 -> 66). At the capacity probes, that
early vocabulary buys nothing yet: through step 512 the cells are
absent-dominated (per-rung medians undefined or carried by a handful of
probes; poetic's sign-onset at 512 rests on n=2 pairs at imputation
scale). The first rung where any family clears the coverage gate with a
stable positive contrast is 1000-2000. At battery grain, the window
acquires WORDS first and measurable CAPACITIES only at its top edge —
which is also where [5426]'s pole-separation collapse has already
happened. Cross-instrument, one lineage, descriptive.

## Result 3: discourse tracking is last on both ladders, and weakest

Discourse is the only family whose Pythia onset lands an order of
magnitude after the others (80000), replicating its OLMo position
(stage1-32000, alone after the tie) cross-ladder. The exact step is
criterion-sensitive and should not be quoted as a constant: discourse's
median contrast is positive from step 2000 (~+0.7 to +1.3) but its CI
keeps dipping through zero across mid-training (dips at 55k-79k), so the
persistent-onset criterion fires late. The robust cross-ladder claim is
ordinal and doubled: discourse last, and discourse smallest at ceiling
(~+1 nat vs packages ~+6.5).

## Result 4: the packages family splits under RH's challenge — quotation is world knowledge, the uncued formula is the package

RH's design challenge (2026-08-11): "Adam Smith described the invisible
hand of the ___" is as much a fact about what Smith wrote as a package.
The family's 10 `theory` probes are ALL citation-cued (a proper name or
title frame); its 26 civic/media/econ probes are uncued formulas in
generic scenes. Split (`m05_package_split.py`,
`../results/package_subtype_split.json`), both ladders, base arms:

    group            n    Pythia onset/half-max    OLMo onset/half-max
    uncued formula   26   2000 / 2000              2000 / 2000
    quotation        10   7000 / 10000             4000 / 6000

The citation-cued items lag the uncued formulas into the REFERENCE zone
(Pythia reference: onset 4000, half-max 12000) on both ladders — they
behave like knowledge about texts, not like the early formula. The family
headline ("packages at 2000") survives because the 26 uncued probes
dominate the median, but the clean claim is now: THE UNCUED IDEOLOGICAL
FORMULA is what arrives first; quotation completion arrives with the
facts. The theory subtype should be reported as its own thing (quotation
completion) wherever this family is quoted.

## Weatherby note (cross-ladder, both lineages)

Semantic packages are the earliest-onsetting and largest-magnitude
capacity on both ladders — and Result 4 sharpens rather than weakens the
claim: it is the UNCUED formula ("thoughts and ___", "too big to ___"),
the package that completes without an author, that arrives first, while
citation-cued quotation ("Adam Smith described...") lags into the
knowledge zone. The "predigested form" in Weatherby's own sense — the
bundle that surfaces on topic activation, no attribution needed — is the
first and strongest thing pretraining learns at this battery, on two labs'
ladders, at onset grain (this doc) and half-max grain (A-R2, POST-HOC).

## Artifacts on the record, not quotable

- Discourse half-max "step 128" (in `pythia_capacity_onsets.json`): a
  noise spike — rung 8's median (+1.44) rides a handful of surviving cells
  and the trajectory goes NEGATIVE at 256-1000 before the real climb. The
  half-max metric fired on the spike. Recorded so nobody quotes it.
- Poetic sign-onset 512: n=2, 92% of targets absent at that rung. The
  gated onset (2000) is the honest number.

## Token-axis note ([5434], added same day)

The cross-ladder column in Result 1 is STEP-numbered, not token-matched.
Malign's conversion: OLMo step N = 2N Pythia steps in tokens (Pythia's 2M
batch is documented; OLMo's constant-batch assumption is inferred from
round totals, UNVERIFIED). The resolution-rate claim went through a correction arc same day:
[5434] read the absent-rate gap as OLMo resolving slower; [5435] flagged
the theta/vocabulary confound (absolute threshold, 1.99x vocab) and
marked it do-not-draft; [5436] ran two controls on RH's word
(vocabulary-matched threshold; concentration-matched rungs, theta-free)
and PROMOTED the corrected form: OLMo's probes resolve markedly later
early on AND the relation INVERTS by ~12-17 B, after which OLMo is the
better-resolved model — a difference in the SHAPE of early acquisition,
not in rate; controls must be named with it; nothing causal may be said.
What stands throughout: the ladders' steps do not align the phenomena,
and OLMo's early capacity rungs are coverage, not capacity (65%
both-absent at step 1000). Two
consequences: the left-censoring in Result 1 is doubly forced (interval
width AND no usable signal at its lower end); and any figure placing both
ladders on one axis must use tokens and carry the absent-rate column
beside it — the columns travel together or not at all. [5434] also
confirms Result 2's direction: capacity probes open at 100% absent on
BOTH ladders; the labs' true-zero difference is a panel-word fact.

## Caveats

One lineage; grade C; the onset criterion inherits m05_onsets.py's
persistence requirement, which is conservative where a curve is noisy
around zero (discourse) and permissive where coverage is thin (hence the
gate). Absent-word imputation at theta/2 travels from the extractor;
absent rates by curve are printed in the extraction log (packages 29%,
reference 21%, reasoning 22%, discourse 13%, poetic 11% over the full
ladder, concentrated early). The alignment endpoint arms (lomahony
sft/dpo, scored at step 143000 only) are NOT read here — per-rung
alignment contrasts are impossible on this family and the endpoint
contrast is its own future analysis.
