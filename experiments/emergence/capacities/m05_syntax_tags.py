"""The syntax artifact, tier 1: spaCy-tag every unique (prompt, word) pair
on the M05 battery, both ladders, in context.

    uv run python experiments/emergence/capacities/m05_syntax_tags.py

RH's word, 2026-08-11 ("start by spacy-tagging all of the completions").
The dedup object: the 13.8M (checkpoint x prompt x word) battery rows across
the OLMo-3 and Pythia ladders collapse to ~338k unique (prompt, word) pairs
once the checkpoint dimension is dropped — the tag of a word as the
continuation of a prompt does not depend on which rung proposed it, which
is also what keeps any later judge blind to training stage by construction.

Each pair is tagged by parsing "<prompt> <word>" and reading the tokens
that span the appended word: UPOS, fine tag, dependency relation, and the
head's text. Deterministic (spaCy en_core_web_sm, version recorded in the
parquet), local, free; re-runnable byte-identically. This artifact does NOT
decide licitness — that needs the licit-category set (registered secondary
5's frozen artifact, LLM-coded per prompt, pending RH's word) or an
endpoint-derived set. It supplies the POS layer both would consume, and
already supports the POS-composition-over-training curve on its own.

Writes data/m05_syntax_tags.parquet:
    prompt, word, n_tokens (spaCy tokens spanning the word),
    upos, tag, dep, head, pos_class, spacy_model, spacy_version

KNOWN ARTIFACT, and why pos_class exists: a determiner with no following
noun (the battery's prompts end mid-phrase, so trailing "the"/"a" is a
common candidate) keeps the correct fine tag DT but UPOS-maps to PRON.
`pos_class` re-derives the coarse class from the PTB fine tag by an
explicit table and is the column the composition curve should use; `upos`
is kept as spaCy emitted it.
