"""Do M01's movers carry M06's passage effect? Stage 1: extract per-word surprisal.

    uv run python meta/M06_generation/scripts/m06_mediation.py [--cap N] [--pairs K]
    -> results/mediation_words.parquet   (pair, role, word, occurrences, tokens,
                                          sum_s_base, sum_s_aligned)

Runs plan_mediation.md, committed at d79b6c0f before this file existed.

THE INSTRUMENT. Every undisturbed passage is scored by BOTH members of its pair
(1,142,944 self rows and 1,142,944 cross rows in `passage`). So for one text:

    s_base(T)      the base model's per-token surprisal
    s_aligned(T)   the aligned model's per-token surprisal, on THE SAME TOKENS

Composition is held fixed BY CONSTRUCTION, not by matching. Every word is its
own control, so the level term has no frequency confound in it at all.

AND NOTHING IS RE-TOKENIZED. `gen_sequences.token_ids` stores the generation's
actual ids -- measured, `length(token_ids) = n_tokens` for all 238,400
undisturbed passages, so token_ids is the GENERATION ALONE and the prompt is not
in it -- and `logprobs` aligns to it 1:1 (475,092 of 476,800 score rows, 99.64%).
The ids are a record, not a reconstruction. Decoding is the only thing needed,
and decoding is a per-vocabulary lookup done once.

GATE R (reconstruction) is what makes the word grouping checkable rather than
assumed. Tokenizers mark word starts differently and this file handles three
conventions. Rather than trust that, it REBUILDS the text from the pieces it
grouped and compares to the stored `text`. If the surfaces do not reassemble
into the string the model actually emitted, the grouping is wrong and the pair
is dropped. A word-grouping rule that has never been observed failing is a rule
you believe in, not one you have tested.

GATE L (length) drops any text whose two logprob arrays disagree with each other
or with token_ids. Measured beforehand: 596 of 238,400 texts have scorer
disagreement, concentrated in BAAI/Aquila2-7B (592) and croissantllm (4).
EXCLUSION IS BY PAIR, NOT BY ROW -- a pair whose tokenizers disagree on 1% of
texts is not trustworthy on the other 99%.

Note `data/f11_l2_tokenizer_pairs.json` called croissantllm ID-SAFE on 76
probes while the real corpus produces 4 disagreements. The probes are coarser
than the property; the gate here runs on the actual population.
