"""Does alignment change a passage's PATH SHAPE, or only its extent?

    uv run python meta/M06_generation/scripts/m06_crosslingual_ordering.py [--full]
    -> results/crosslingual_ordering[_full].json

`findings/drift_metric_audit.md` retired `directedness` (it is 1.681/n, Spearman
-0.92 against sentence count) and named the replacement:

    ordering = mean(successive distances) - mean(all pairwise distances)

Under a RANDOM ordering of a passage's own sentences the expected successive
distance IS the mean of all pairwise distances, so this is a pure SEQUENCE
measure: same sentences, same count, same composition, only the order differs.
Negative means adjacent sentences are closer than a reshuffle would give, i.e.
local coherence. The audit specified it, `m06_crosslingual_drift.py` was wired
to persist `mean_pairwise` for it, and it had never been computed.

MEASURED HERE, untruncated: zh -0.0266, en -0.0339 (both languages locally
coherent, as any real text should be), and n-dependence -0.217 / -0.169 against
`total_drift`'s +0.33 to +0.42. Less n-driven, though NOT independent by
construction: the NULL is n-free, the observed deviation from it need not be.

THE CONTRAST IS RUN BESIDE `mean_drift` ON PURPOSE. A null is only worth
reporting next to a positive control drawn from the same pairs, the same matched
prompts and the same estimator; otherwise it is indistinguishable from an
instrument that cannot fire.
