Same prompts, same models as the logit grain, so the comparison isolates GRAIN: distribution vs sampled behaviour. Deliverables: a generation-side arm classifier (plateau form, grid declared), a generation-side per-word AUC vector, the cross-grain replication correlation, and the amplification map.

# Plan: P on passages — does the arm signature survive the trip to the page?

RH's question (2026-08-13, in session): can we predict base/aligned from
their GENERATIONS, and do the AUCs there replicate the AUCs from next-word
probabilities? Drafted by the lacan seat; M06 is the module because the
substrate is the passage corpus and the strata are M06's own.

## Why this comparison is clean

The passage corpus's prompts are M01 sites and its 42 pairs are the
lineage representatives — the same objects the logit-side instruments run
on. Both grains can therefore be computed on IDENTICAL prompts and models,
and the comparison isolates exactly one thing: the next-word DISTRIBUTION
against 100-200 tokens of SAMPLED TEXT at temp 1.0. Policy against
behaviour, everything else held.

## Population

`gen_sequences`, `corpus='passage'`, **UNDISTURBED ARM ONLY for the
primary** (`forced_word=''`; the forced arms condition text on injected
words and are a secondary replication table, per plan A Amendment §1).
Strata: M06's declared screens, joined from `m06_text_flags.parquet` on
(pair, role, prompt_id, seq_idx) WITH the explosion assert. Primary
stratum: prose AND non-degenerate AND English (the hardened stratum).
**SmolLM2-360M is EXCLUDED from the stratified primary** — its flag rows
are ambiguous by key (two runs, disagreeing flags, [5707]) — and rides in
the pooled read only; n = 41 pairs primary. Everything is reported with
its stratum named.

## The instruments

Word rates per model: `fields.tokens()` over passage text (the campaign
tokenizer, matching M02's field analysis), counts per 1,000 tokens over
the model's pooled hardened-stratum undisturbed passages.

  I1  GENERATION-SIDE PER-WORD ARM AUC. For each word present in >= 20
      models, the AUC of its per-model rate over the arm label. High =
      aligned-side, matching `word_auc_en.tsv`'s orientation. Compositional
      caveat inherited: rates are shares of emitted tokens, so the
      observed-median / arm-flip-null / concentration references from
      `k_word_auc` are computed and reported the same way.

  I2  GENERATION-SIDE ARM CLASSIFIER. Columns = top-k words by pooled
      frequency, values = per-model rates, logistic with L2, leave-one-org-
      out, within-lineage arm-flip null. **The grid is declared here, and
      the PLATEAU is the quotable form, never a cell** (the [5720]-era
      lesson): k in {25, 50, 100, 200}.

  I3  CROSS-GRAIN REPLICATION. Spearman of I1 against (a) the canonical
      `word_auc_en.tsv` vector and (b) a logit-side per-word AUC recomputed
      ON THE PASSAGE PROMPTS ONLY (a `--prompts` variant of `k_word_auc`,
      suffixed output, nothing overwritten). (b) is the primary comparison:
      vectors are prompt-conditional at +0.711 even within grain, so (a)
      carries a known ceiling and is context, not the test.

  I4  THE AMPLIFICATION MAP (exploratory, descriptive, no directions).
      Per shared word: gen-side AUC minus logit-side AUC (same prompts).
      Positive = the page amplifies the word's arm signal beyond its
      distributional disposition (candidates: self-reinforcing register,
      formatting-adjacent vocabulary); negative = distributional signal
      that sampling rarely realises (candidates: tail-rank words). Field
      decomposition of the map via `k_field_poles` machinery.

  I5  FORCED-ARM SIGNATURE DISPLACEMENT (amendment, 2026-08-13, RH's
      question, added BEFORE the full run; the smoke did not touch forced
      arms). Passage-level axis score: the rate-weighted mean axis position
      of the passage's content words, THE FORCED WORD ITSELF EXCLUDED from
      the score; echo (rate of the forced word in the generation) travels
      as its own column, since repeating the faller is one form of being
      dragged and must not contaminate the composition measure.

        I5a  within the ALIGNED arm, paired per (pair, prompt):
             faller - matched, and riser_matched - matched -- same aligned
             probability, only the word's movement class differs (the
             corpus's own ladder, [5687]).
        I5b  the difference-in-differences against base:
             (aligned_faller - aligned_matched) - (base_faller -
             base_matched) -- alignment-specific response, priming
             subtracted.

      Three readings declared WITHOUT direction, all three written as
      findings: DRAGGED (faller pulls the aligned text toward the base
      pole; the signature is a disposition), HOMEOSTATIC (aligned text
      overcorrects past its matched control; the signature defends
      itself), ASCENT (composition flat but M02's second-order markers
      rise; the response is a level shift, not a vocabulary shift --
      checked with the committed marker sets on the same passages).
      Strata and per-1,000-token denominators as in I1; forced arms are
      SECONDARY population per plan A Amendment 1, so I5 is reported
      beside the undisturbed primary, never pooled with it.

  I6  MARKED vs UNMARKED SITE SIGNATURE (amendment, 2026-08-13, RH's
      question, added AFTER I1-I5 ran but BEFORE this instrument was
      built or any of its numbers existed; I5's results are the only
      prior knowledge and are cited as the priming prediction below).
      UNDISTURBED passages only, hardened stratum, SmolLM2 excluded.
      Prompts join to `prompt_catalogue` ON PROMPT TEXT (never id, the
      standing rule) for pair_role in {MARKED, UNMARKED}, twins paired
      by pair_id; unjoined prompt texts are counted and reported, not
      silently dropped. Per-passage axis score exactly as I5 (rate-
      weighted mean GloVe axis position of content words; no exclusion
      word here). Aggregate per (model pair, role, pair_id, pair_role)
      over that side's passages; a twin enters only if BOTH sides are
      present for that (pair, role).

        I6a  within each arm, paired per (pair, pair_id):
             MARKED - UNMARKED axis score, sign test.
        I6b  the difference-in-differences:
             (aligned MARKED-excess) - (base MARKED-excess), paired per
             (pair, pair_id).

      Declared readings: from I5's dragged-symmetric result, MARKED
      content is EXPECTED to pull composition base-poleward in BOTH
      arms (priming; I6a directional in both). The open question is
      I6b, declared without direction: TONIC (DiD null; the interiority
      signature is a constant register shift and site-specificity lives
      only at the distribution grain, F01's) vs PHASIC (DiD non-null;
      alignment modulates the signature at transgressive sites beyond
      priming -- if the aligned excess is MORE interior at MARKED sites
      the page shows a site-conditional deployment, the generation-grain
      analogue of F01's specificity; if LESS, the site drags aligned
      text harder than base, a vulnerability reading). Axis orientation
      is anchored empirically in the output (per-role ambient means),
      not assumed from the axis file's sign. Domain decomposition
      (taboo/violence/animal/betrayal/property/sexual) exploratory,
      descriptive, no directions. Per-cell scores persisted.

  I7  SITE x FORCED-WORD INTERACTION (amendment, 2026-08-13, RH's
      question, added after I5/I6 ran but before this instrument was
      built or any of its numbers existed). Does the faller's drag
      depend on the site? Transgressive prompt PLUS demoted word vs
      neutral prompt PLUS demoted word: the 2x2 the corpus supports (68
      pair_id twins have BOTH sides in the forced corpus; support
      checked before this declaration, no outcomes looked at).
      Cell values are the I5 per-cell parquet's axis scores, already
      second-seated at the aggregation layer ([5760]); site labels
      attach by mapping (pair, prompt) to prompt TEXT within
      gen_sequences itself (asserting the map is single-valued) and
      joining text to the catalogue -- the id fragment never crosses a
      system boundary.

        DRAG(pair, role, side)  = faller - matched cell means, within
                                  each twin side
        I7a  per arm, paired per (pair, pair_id):
             DRAG(MARKED) - DRAG(UNMARKED), sign test
        I7b  triple difference: I7a(aligned) - I7a(base), paired per
             (pair, pair_id)

      Declared readings: I5 and I6 established both main effects as
      arm-symmetric priming (word drags, site drags, DiDs null). The
      open question is the INTERACTION, declared without direction:
      ADDITIVE (I7a null in both arms -- word-priming and site-priming
      compose independently), POTENTIATED (I7a positive -- the site
      amplifies the faller's drag; if arm-symmetric it is more priming,
      and only I7b non-null would make it an alignment operation),
      SATURATED (I7a negative -- transgressive context absorbs the
      faller; the word adds less where the site already primed).
      The tonic picture predicts I7b null; that prediction is written
      here before the number. Echo by site type travels as an
      exploratory column (the [5757] echo asymmetry, split MARKED vs
      UNMARKED), descriptive only.

## Declared directions

  P1 (directional, from M02's field replication on f11_l2 and the M06
      pilot's lexical carryover): I3(b) is POSITIVE and substantial —
      the signature survives to the page.
  Q1 (open): whether I2's plateau reaches the logit classifier's 0.90+.
      Lower is expected on power alone (41 pairs, ~190 undisturbed prompts
      per model vs 2,229); the comparison is reported against a
      same-population logit rerun, not against the headline plateau.
  Q2 (open): the amplification map's field structure. Exploratory.

## Fences, before any number

- ANTI-CONFLATION: usage-rate AUC and candidate-share AUC are different
  objects even when correlated; TTR/Gini clauses apply; no sentence reads
  one as the other.
- 41 pairs primary (SmolLM2 flag ambiguity), 42 pooled.
- Length enters through the per-1,000-token denominator; list-formatting
  and degeneracy through the stratum, not through word rates.
- One corpus, one prompt family: I3(a)'s ceiling is stated wherever (a)
  is shown.

## Stages

  SMOKE (this commit): 4 scout pairs (Amber, Olmo-3, Llama-3.1, gemma-2),
  undisturbed hardened stratum, pipeline end to end — flag join integrity
  (explosion assert), rate computation, a handful of I1 values for words
  with known logit-side positions, I3 direction on the smoke vocabulary.
  EYEBALL GRADE; nothing from the smoke is quoted, per M06 house style.

  FULL: all 41/42 pairs, all four instruments, results to
  `results/p_on_passages.json`; the `k_word_auc --prompts` variant run
  beside it. No new compute anywhere; everything reads CH and the flags.

Producer: `scripts/m06_p_on_passages.py`.
